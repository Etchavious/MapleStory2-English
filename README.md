# Maplestory2-English
https://translate.maplestory2.info

The purpose of this is to continue the English translations of MapleStory 2 (due to the global service being shut down).

The goal is to keep the translations as true to the Korean text. 

The translations are free to use for anyone. Just please continue to support this project.

The repo is organized as so:
 
- **Latest-GMS2** - The latest and last strings from GMS2.
- **Latest-KMS2** - The latest KMS2 strings from the KMS2 client. 
- **Translated** - This is the compilation of the latest GMS2 strings with this project's translations. Any strings with Korean text means it has not yet been translated. If you wish to create your own compiled Xml data file for MS2, this is what you would use.
- **build** - These xmls are used for the site only. They are converted to a format that Weblate (the translation tool) takes.

# Compiling XML.m2d
I will normally compile new m2ds either every KMS2 patch or after a good amount of progress has been done translating. These will be posted in the release.

However, if you do not wish to rely on me, here are the steps to DIY.

1. You will need [Miyuyami's MS2 Create Tool](https://github.com/Miyuyami/MS2Tools)
2. Miyuyami's instructions should be clear as to how create it but just incase, make sure your argument settings for mode is **NS2F**
