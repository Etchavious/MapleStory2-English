# Maplestory2-English
https://translate.maplestory2.info

The purpose of this is to continue the English translations of MapleStory 2 (due to the global service being shut down).

The goal is to keep the translations as true to the Korean text. 

The translations are free to use for anyone. Just please continue to support this project.

The repo is organized as so:
 
- **Latest-GMS2** - The latest and last strings from GMS2.
- **Latest-KMS2** - The latest KMS2 strings from the KMS2 client. 
- **build** - These xmls are used for the site only. They are converted to a format that Weblate (the translation tool) takes.
