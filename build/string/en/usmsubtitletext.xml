  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption1">People say the darkness has been wiped from our world... but I know\nwhat I've seen.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption2">There is darkness in the hearts of our people.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption3">The strong always tread upon the weak. It happened to me.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption4">However…</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption5">The world still has heroes who can help the weak.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption6">A kind soul helped me on that fateful day, so I know they're\nout there.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption7">Those who can help and protect others are the people who make\nthis world great.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption8">I'm going to become one of those heroes...</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Knight_caption9">No matter what.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption1">People fear the unknown. My parents did.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption2">The darkness in me drove them to abandon me.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption3">If the old man hadn't found me and taken me in…</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption4">I probably wouldn't be here.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption5">The old man didn't care about the power within me and raised me\nas his own.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption6">History, science, art... he taught me so many things I didn't care about.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption7">I found out later that he was once Maple World's greatest hero.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption8">I should thank him for raising me, and teaching me to be strong.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption9">And I'll surpass him, by becoming a stronger warrior!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption10">New heroes are meant to eclipse those that came before.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption11">Isn't that the best way to show respect for their efforts?</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Berserker_caption12">So get ready, old man! Today's the day I beat you!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption1">Class, open your textbooks to…</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption2">What's this? We're one student short.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption3">That's fine. We can wait.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption4">Professor! We have quite a lot of magic to learn today.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption5">Are you going to waste our time waiting for one tardy student?</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption6">An astute point, as usual, Miss Class President.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption7">Let's begin. What can anyone here tell me about monsters?</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption8">My brightest student…</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption9">...is skipping class. Again.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption10">So much wasted genius…</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Wizard_caption11">Wah, I don't know!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Priest_caption1">After the darkness vanished 15 years ago, I thought my duty would be\nto pray and sing of our past glory.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Priest_caption2">When I heard our peace was threatened again, a great fear grew\nin my heart.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Priest_caption3">But along with that fear... was hope. Hope that I would find\nnew purpose.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Priest_caption4">The guardian priests serve the will of the divine light.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Priest_caption5">And so, it is my duty to bring glory to this land once more!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Ranger_caption1">Not everything is as simple as it appears.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Ranger_caption2">It's an easy truth to forget.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Ranger_caption3">But no matter how hidden, the truth is always revealed in the end.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Ranger_caption4">Sometimes, you get to see the real side of a person for just a moment.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Ranger_caption5">A person who is stronger than anyone else, but keeps it hidden...</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Ranger_caption6">A person who never hesitates to help when they are needed...</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Ranger_caption7">A person whose footsteps I work hard to follow in.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_HeavyGunner_caption1">My whole life, people have told me...</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_HeavyGunner_caption2">&amp;quot;Science alone cannot bring peace to Maple World.&amp;quot;</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_HeavyGunner_caption3">That is a reasonable hypothesis... if you're an idiot!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_HeavyGunner_caption4">The right technology? It can accomplish anything. It can break through\nany barrier. It can level any playing field!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_HeavyGunner_caption5">So, my faithful assistant... Who's going to fix the world?</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_HeavyGunner_caption6">You are, Boss!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_HeavyGunner_caption7">A perfect answer! 10 out of 10!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Thief_caption1">I can't remember anything about my parents.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Thief_caption2">My earliest childhood memories are of cold, dirty alleyways.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Thief_caption3">But I was never alone.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Thief_caption4">My friends were my family, the ones who stood by me.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Thief_caption5">Even now, we live the way we want. Our limits are our own.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Thief_caption6">No one can hold us back. I didn't choose the life of a rogue...</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Thief_caption7">But I love it!</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption1">The Rooks.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption2">We are the vanguard of darkness led by the Dark Lord, one of\nthe Seven Commanders.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption3">We have one mission: To eliminate everything that stands in\nthe way of the Black Mage.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption4">As a Rook, my own thoughts and emotions were purged so that\nI could focus on my work.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption5">However…</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption6">I've begun to... feel again. And those feelings confuse me.</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption7">Am I really working toward a better world?</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption8">Am I becoming a monster?</str>
  <str key="JobIntro_Assassin_caption9">For once... I don't know what to do…</str>
  <str key="RuneBlader_Intro_caption1">Farewell...</str>
  <str key="RuneBlader_Intro_caption2">Master.</str>
  <str key="RuneBlader_Intro_caption3">Don't throw your life away.</str>
  <str key="RuneBlader_Intro_caption4">Your destiny lies elsewhere.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption1">You've answered the call. Now hear the story!</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption2">It begins with two goddesses: one light, one dark.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption3">They created many worlds, but Maple World was their\ngreatest.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption4">In every realm, there must be balance.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption5">But the goddess of light loved Maple World and warded it\nagainst the darkness.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption6">Fearing this imbalance, the goddess of darkness lashed out.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption7">So began their terrible war.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption8">The battle was long and brutal, but, with the help of her sages,\nthe goddess of light defeated her sister.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption9">As the goddess of darkness fell, she unleashed her fury,\npoisoning Maple World with her power.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption10">Unwilling to see her beloved creation destroyed, the goddess of light\nsacrificed herself to save it.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption11">What remained of her power became the great protector,\nEmpress Ereve.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption12">Ereve gathered seven heroes to stand against the darkness.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption13">Try as they might, they could not stop their world's slow corruption.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption14">Ereve and her sages created three relics with power over life, space,\nand time: the Lapentas.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption15">These Lapentas could gather up the darkness and cleanse it all at once.\nSo they thought...</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption16">The day of their bold plan came, and the shadows pooled\nin one place...</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption17">Even as they cast their purification ritual, the sages were gripped\nby the darkness.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption18">It took all of the Lapentas' power to protect Maple World from being\nutterly destroyed.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption19">The ritual site was corrupted, the whole region becoming\na dreaded no-man's land.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption20">Two of Ereve's heroes, Cerian and Balon, stepped forward.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption21">They journeyed into this &amp;quot;Land of Darkness&amp;quot; on a mission to save\nanyone trapped inside.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption22">There, they worked to complete the purification ritual... and,\nin doing so, they met their end.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption23">The Land of Darkness was sealed away, where it could hurt\nno one else.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption24">With their noble sacrifice, these two heroes had bought peace.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption25">But now, the shadows stir once more, and this miraculous peace\nis nearing its end.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption26">The time has come for champions to rise again.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption27">This is a story of heroes.</str>
  <str key="Common_Opening_caption28">This... is your story.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption1">There's a chance we might be outnumbered.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption2">Indeed…</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption3">Try and keep up.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption4">I see you've found new allies.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption5">They won't save you from me.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption6">You!?</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption7">Playtime is over—</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption8">Time to die.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption9">Bring it on!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption10">Hurry up, the ship's about to launch!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption11">Flight checks complete—\nBut we still have crew on the ground!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption12">We cannot wait any longer.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption13">But what about—</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption14">Aye captain!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption15">Take us up!\nFire the XR shells, on my markl!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption16">What?!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption17">And fire!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption18">This isn't over.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption19">Karl, Luanna. Look there.\nThey really did it.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption20">A new era dawns on Maple World.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption21">Brave guardians, please watch over us from above.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption22">Safe journeys, Sky Fortress.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption23">No mercy!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption24">It's over for you!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption25">En garde!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption26">Let's go!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption27">This might burn!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption28">Spin 'em up!</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption30">Don't give up.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption31">간다.</str>
  <str key="SkyFortress_Intro_caption32">Surprise!</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption1">Brighter than the stars in the night</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption2">Together our hearts shine</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption3">So radiantly</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption4">Forget the darkness of the past\n(Rise up again)</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption5">And the trembling in your heart\n(Don't be afraid)</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption6">Your story has only just begun\n(Don't lose heart)</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption7">The future is calling\n(I'm right beside you)</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption8">Don't you dare forget</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption9">That guiding light of hope\nis a promise</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption10">Run forth untethered\nby your fear</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption11">Stay true to yourself and your dream\nwill come to pass</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption12">It's far too soon for your story to end</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption13">Call out the name\nthat trembles on your lips</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption14">Even when you have no voice,\nI'll hear your cry</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption15">Dry your eyes,\n'cause I'll</str>
  <str key="Lapenta_Frontier_Intro_caption16">Hold you tight</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption1">사라졌던 영웅의 등장에 놀랐는가?</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption2">그렇다. 내가 바로 빛의 마법사 킬리안이다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption3">그리고 또 다른 이름</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption4">검은 마법사.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption5">놀라는 것도 무리는 아니지.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption6">한때 7영웅의 수장이 바로 나였으니.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption7">이제 그날의 진실을 말할 때가 된 것 같구나.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption8">나는 라펜타 봉인을 위해</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption9">7영웅 중 하나이자 나의 친우인 바론과 함께\n 어둠의 땅으로 향했다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption10">그리고, 그곳에 도달한 우리는 깨달았지.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption11">봉인을 위해선 여제 에레브의 힘이 필요하다는 것을.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption12">이를 알리기 위해 바론은 트라이아로 향했다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption13">나는 그곳에 남아 상황을 지켜보았지만</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption14">생각보다 빠르게 악화되는 봉인의 상태에\n결단을 내려야만 했다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption15">혼자서라도 봉인을 시도해야 했어.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption16">내 목숨과 바꿔서라도 말이야.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption17">다행히 난 봉인에 성공했지만 정신이 혼미해지고 있었다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption18">그리고 돌연, 바론의 기운이 끊어졌다!</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption19">나는, 처음으로 여제를 의심했다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption20">여제가 늦는 것이 아니라 \n우리 요청이 묵살당한 거라면?</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption21">빛의 상징인 여제가 우릴 버렸다면…?</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption22">그 순간, 나는 보았다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption23">빛의 여제가 가진 강력한 힘이 이 세상을 멸망시키는 모습을.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption24">빛의 창 끝이 어둠이 아닌 우리를 향하는 날</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption25">우리가 맞게 될 빛으로부터의 파멸을…</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption26">그날 이후 나는 여제의 파멸을 막기 위해 여러 계획을 세우고 실행해왔다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption27">그 중 가장 심혈을 기울여 준비한 것이 바로 이, 검은 달이다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption28">여제 에레브… 그녀는 이곳에 봉인되어야 해.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption29">최근 트라이아에 나타난 검은 물질들을 보았겠지?</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption30">그건 바로, 여제 안에 잠들어 있던 불안의 미래가 형상화되어 나타난 것.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption31">언젠가 다가올 파멸의 증거다!</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption32">빛으로부터의 파멸</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption33">그 예언을 막기 위한 방법은 오직 이것 뿐이다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption34">과거의 영웅은 죽었다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption35">내게 남은 것은 오직 세상의 파괴를 막기 위한 간절한 소망 뿐.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption36">예언을 아는 자라면, 이 진실을 외면할 수 없을 것이다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption37">애송이, 이제 너도 모든 것을 알게 되었고…</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption38">선택만이 남았다.</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption39">진실과 거짓</str>
  <str key="KiliansTruth_caption40">선택하라</str>
